Maybe make 2 seperate components? 

stoxy-string
stoxy-object

Where String is for just normal values and the Object variant is for json object values

Usage of String (WIP):

```html
<stoxy-string>my.stoxy.string</stoxy-string>
```

Usage of Object:

```html
<stoxy-object key="user" prefix="u">
    <h2> Profile of u.name</h2>
    <p>Hello, u.name. Your profile has been visited u.profileViewCount times today</p>
</stoxy-object>
```

Ideas:

- Make the `.` a accessor, like it's in javascript, so if for example the user uses the following:
```
<stoxy-string>user.information.name</stoxy-string>
```
, the accessor would fetch the the object `user` from the indexedDB and then access it's property information and then name


- Make Stoxy store the last 3(or 5?) queries in memory so you don't have to re-query them every time.
e.g. a profile page accessing multiple user information fields
