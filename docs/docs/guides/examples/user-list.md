# Examples >> User Listing

You can find a example of a User listing app in the Codesandbox below.

The application provides functionality for adding and removing users, and sorting them by their properties.

You can also find the code in [The github repo](https://github.com/Matsuuu/stoxy/tree/main/examples/user-list)

The example below uses no other library than Stoxy to provide the reactive experience.
