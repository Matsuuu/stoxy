When using Stoxy elements, the developer\ndoesn't need to worry about reacting to state changes. The elements handle their state and updates to said state\nautomatically, without any input from the developer. \nThe updates are ran in a dynamic fashion, and only the content that has updated will be changed. \nWith elements like Stoxy Repeat , the iterable stateobject are\ncompared to their old state, and sorted automatically to match the new order of the\nstate array. Only the items in the wrong order are moved around the DOM, and the ones that didn't change order\nwill be kept untouched.","section":"guides"},"21":{"title":"Getting started: Core functionality","headline":"Reactivity","body":"On top of the reactivity provided by the Stoxy elements, the developer can also subscribe to the\nstate updates happening around their web application. \nThe developer is able to set a callback function to be called with the new data set onto the state, as the\nstate updates.
